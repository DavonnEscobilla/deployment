In summary, this is a new level of knowledge as I learned how to deploy the model that I have acquired from Activity 9.1. I have saved the best model and used it for deployment. Based on the given notebook, I modified the shaping of the images in order for my input model to fit in. The provided youtube video helped me to deploy this app, by creating the necessary codes and input libraries. This model has 86% accuracy, there are some images that cannot be predicted right. Overall, this activity is a great knowledge to have for future deployments of more efficient model.
